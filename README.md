# My CLIP-Challange

It all started with a simple challenge: could we find the perfect words that make an AI see an image the way we do?

Armed with coffee, curiosity, and five random images, our team set out to test CLIP, OpenAI’s vision-language model that claims to understand both pictures and text. The goal sounded simple enough — find the words or captions that get the highest similarity scores between image and text embeddings.

But as soon as we started, it became clear: CLIP has opinions. It doesn’t just look at an image and say, “Oh, that’s a cat.” It weighs every detail — tone, phrasing, and even how “human” your description sounds.

Our early attempts were rough. One word felt too vague, another too specific. Sometimes we nailed it, other times CLIP stubbornly disagreed. We weren’t just tuning a model; we were trying to speak its language.

# Where the Fun Began

It turns out, CLIP is picky — almost too picky. One wrong adjective and your score tanks. But tweak the phrasing just a little — add “a photo of,” change “dog” to “puppy,” or throw in a poetic twist — and suddenly CLIP believes you understand its language.

That’s when we realized: this wasn’t just a coding project. It was a game of translation, creativity, and a little bit of mind-reading between human and machine.
